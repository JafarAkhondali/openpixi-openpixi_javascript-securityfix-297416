Introduction:

Javascript version of OpenPixi

This is the JavaScript version of OpenPixi. It uses three.js for creating webGL content and dat.gui
for the user interface.
Mind that it is still a work in progress.

Usage:
===================
After downloading you can make it run by opening index.html in a browser of your choice. 
So far it has been tested successfully in Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer. 
Note that in order to make it run floating-point textures and vertex shader textures need to be
supported on your device. 

A few variables can be changed using the GUI. To make the particles move a value for E must be set.
To apply changes, reset needs to be clicked.
Currently particle movement and solving of the Lorentz-equation are implemented. Solving of the 
Maxwell Equations is under way.

To edit the source code you can use any IDE that supports HTML and JavaScript or just a simple text
editor.
